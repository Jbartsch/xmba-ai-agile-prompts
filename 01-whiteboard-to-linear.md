# Prompt 1: Whiteboard to Linear

**When:** After the whiteboard session, with Claude + Linear MCP connected.

**What you need:**
- A clear photo of your whiteboard
- Your MVP goal sentence from the whiteboard
- Your Linear workspace set up

---

## The Prompt

```
Here's a photo of our product whiteboard for our MVP.

Our MVP goal: [paste your goal sentence from the whiteboard].

Please:
1. Read everything on the whiteboard
2. Turn each item into a clear ticket with:
   - A short, descriptive title
   - A description of what needs to be built
   - 2-3 acceptance criteria (how do we know it's done?)
3. Mark the ones we circled as high priority
4. Create all of these as Linear issues in my workspace
```

---

## How to Use

1. Take a clear, well-lit photo of your whiteboard
2. Open Claude (with Linear connected via Settings > Integrations)
3. Upload the photo + paste the prompt above
4. Review what Claude generates — adjust anything that's off
5. Check linear.app — your board should be populated

## Tips

- If the photo is blurry, retake it. Claude needs to read your handwriting.
- If MCP doesn't connect, Claude will generate the tickets as text. Copy-paste them into Linear manually.
- If you have too many items, tell Claude: "Focus on the top 8-10 items only"
