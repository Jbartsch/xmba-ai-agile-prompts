# Prompt 3: Sprint Build Workflow

**When:** Afternoon build sprint. Use in Replit with Linear MCP connected.

**What you need:**
- Replit project open (Day 6 prototype or new from template)
- Linear connected to Replit (via Integrations pane)

---

## Pick a Ticket

```
Show me my highest-priority open ticket in Linear.

Show me the title, description, and acceptance criteria.
```

## Build a Ticket

```
Build this feature: [ticket title]

Here's what it should do:
[paste ticket description]

Acceptance criteria:
[paste acceptance criteria]

Use a clean, modern design. Don't add any features I didn't ask for.
```

## Check Your Work

```
Show me the acceptance criteria for [ticket title].
Did we meet all of them? What's missing?
```

## Mark It Done

```
Mark [ticket title] as Done in Linear.
What's my next highest-priority open ticket?
```

---

## The Rhythm

```
Pick → Build → Check → Done → Next
```

One ticket at a time. Finish it before starting the next.

## Tips

- **Your ticket IS your prompt.** The description + acceptance criteria give you 80% of what you need. Just add visual details (colors, layout, style).
- **One change at a time.** Don't ask Replit to build 5 things at once.
- **When stuck for more than 10 minutes:** screenshot what you have, start a new Replit Agent conversation, paste the screenshot + describe the one thing you need to change.
- **If Replit builds something wrong:** start a new conversation. Long conversations accumulate confusion.
