# Prompt 3: Sprint Build Workflow

**When:** Afternoon build sprint. Use in Replit with Linear MCP connected.

**What you need:**
- Replit project open (Day 6 prototype or new from template)
- Linear connected to Replit (via Integrations pane)

---

## Build a Ticket

```
Build the feature described in [issue ID, e.g. ABC-12].

Use a clean, modern design. Don't add any features not in the ticket.
```

Copy the issue ID from the Linear UI (e.g. `ABC-12`). The MCP fetches the title, description, and acceptance criteria automatically.

## Check Your Work

```
Check [issue ID] — did we meet all the acceptance criteria? What's missing?
```

## Mark It Done

```
Mark [issue ID] as Done in Linear.
What's my next highest-priority open ticket?
```

---

## The Rhythm

```
Build → Check → Done → Next
```

One ticket at a time. Finish it before starting the next.

## Tips

- **Your ticket IS your prompt.** The MCP pulls the full ticket — description, acceptance criteria, priority. You just reference the issue ID.
- **One change at a time.** Don't ask Replit to build 5 things at once.
- **When stuck for more than 10 minutes:** screenshot what you have, start a new Replit Agent conversation, paste the screenshot + describe the one thing you need to change.
- **If Replit builds something wrong:** start a new conversation. Long conversations accumulate confusion.
