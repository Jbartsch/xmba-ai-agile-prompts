# Prompt 2: Refine Your Backlog

**When:** After Prompt 1 has populated your Linear board.

**What you need:**
- A populated Linear board (from Prompt 1)
- Your Linear project name

---

## The Prompt

```
Look at my Linear backlog for [project name].

Please help me refine it:

1. PRIORITIZE: Label each ticket as:
   - Now (must have for today's demo)
   - Next (important but not for today)
   - Later (nice to have)
   Rule: maximum 3 tickets can be "Now"

2. SIZE: Estimate each "Now" ticket as:
   - S (Small): 15-20 min with vibe coding
   - M (Medium): 30-45 min with vibe coding
   - L (Large): 60+ min — suggest how to split it

3. ADD SPECS: For each "Now" ticket, make sure it has:
   - Clear acceptance criteria (how do we know it's done?)
   - A brief description of what the user should see/experience

Update the tickets in Linear with these labels and details.
```

## How to Use

1. Open your Claude conversation (Linear is still connected)
2. Paste this prompt
3. Review Claude's suggestions — adjust priorities if needed
4. Check Linear — tickets should now have labels + specs

## Tips

- The key constraint is **maximum 3 tickets in "Now"**. This forces real prioritization.
- If Claude's prioritization doesn't match what the team wants — override it. Claude suggests, the team decides.
- If everything is sized "L", your scope is too big. Ask Claude to help split tickets.
